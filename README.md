# MIPS-Machine
The Purpose of this program is to simulate a MIPS assembly processor. 
The code will load a file with MIPS instructions, decode the instructions, execute them, and then store the output into the registers. 

## How to use: 
### > ./MIPSmachine 
### > load *filename*: Will load a file of MIPS instructions
### > regs : Will print the registers
### > reg *input* : Takes user input, meaning name of a register, and outputs the value within the register in both decimal and hex
### > next : runs a single instruction at a time 
### > run : runs all remaining instructions left in the file
