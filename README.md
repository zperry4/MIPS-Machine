# MIPS-Machine
The Purpose of this program is to simulate a MIPS assembly processor. 
The code will load a file with MIPS instructions, decode the instructions, execute them, and then store the output into the registers. 

The two bin files within the master branch are two working input files that can be ran and used with the program. 

## How to use: 
### > ./MIPSmachine 
### > load *filename*: Will load a file of MIPS instructions
### > regs : Will print the registers
### > reg *input* : Takes user input, meaning name of a register, and outputs the value within the register in both decimal and hex
### > next : runs a single instruction at a time 
### > run : runs all remaining instructions left in the file
